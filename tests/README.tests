Testing init involves some different approaches, like unit testing and
fuzzy (currently, for inittab parser only).

Unit test

Only for inittab parser at this moment. Perform some tests for
`inittab_parse_entry` function.

To generate unit test executable, run `make tests`. It should generate
`parser_test` executable - which must run with no issues.

Fuzzy testing

American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) is run on a single executable, using
`tests/data/parser` files as input for the fuzzy tool.

To generate AFL ready executable, run `make tests`. It should generate
`afl_parser_test` executable - that can be run with a command like
`afl-fuzz -i tests/data -o fuzz-results/ ./afl_parser_test @@`.
See AFL documentation for more details.
