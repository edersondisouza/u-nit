FEATURES
========
- Decide on proper log system instead of current, build-time defined,
  single file to write it all.
- On safe-mode.c, change current logic to substitute tags <exitcode> and
  <proc> to something simpler, since now init has its own cmdline parser.

TESTS
=====
- Increase general coverage of current tests.
- Check why, on mkosi generated image, there's no watchdog device,
  despite QEMU being instructed to create it.
- libfiu is nice, but apparently, there's no way to make fault injection
  tests deterministic. Right now, tests are run a number of times with
  some probability of injecting fault. This helps increase coverage,
  but may not be enough.
- qemu-tests.sh has too many parameters: evaluate which ones are
  necessary and remove the others. If any of those is not available
  on all environments (like `-enable-kvm`), it may be better to
  parametrise it.
- It is expected that deemed safe programs are able to nicely handle
  SIGTERM - i.e., they will catch it and exit with exit code 0 if
  everything is fine. However, default `/usr/bin/kill` is not like
  that, so, in slow environments, it may receive SIGTERM from pid 1
  and exit abruptly. A simple solution is simply write our own program
  to send signals to pid 1, one that is fine with receiving SIGTERM.

MISRA-C
=======
- There are various deviations right now in the code. Decide which
  ones should should be ironed out and which we'll file deviation
  records.
