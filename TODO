FEATURES
========
- Decide on proper log system instead of current, build-time defined,
  single file to write it all.
- On safe-mode.c, change current logic to substitute tags <exitcode> and
  <proc> to something simpler, since now init has its own cmdline parser.

TESTS
=====
- Increase general coverage of current tests.
- Check why, on mkosi generated image, there's no watchdog device,
  despite QEMU being instructed to create it.
- libfiu is nice, but apparently, there's no way to make fault injection
  tests deterministic. Right now, tests are run a number of times with
  some probability of injecting fault. This helps increase coverage,
  but may not be enough.
- qemu-tests.sh has too many parameters: evaluate which ones are
  necessary and remove the others. If any of those is not available
  on all environments (like `-enable-kvm`), it may be better to
  parametrise it.

MISRA-C
=======
- There are various deviations right now in the code. Decide which
  ones should should be ironed out and which we'll file deviation
  records.
