FEATURES
========
- Start safe mode application after abnormal termination of a `safe`
  application (as defined on inittab). init should create a process
  for it on its own startup and wait for some kind of signal to
  exec the safe application. This should avoid init being unable to
  start safe application due to system resources exhaustion.
- Mount other filesystems than those of system.
- Properly reap grandchildren process.
- A proper log system

TESTS
=====
- Create - somehow - mocks to aid test error handling. For instance,
  mock 'open()' so it fails, to see how good is our error handling.
- Enable init to run on container - that can be inferred using
  `getenv("container")`. This should allow us to easily test init under
  valgrind or address sanitizer (they need access to `/proc`, that
  would be available on a container environment).
- Increase general coverage of current tests.

MISRA-C
=======
- There are various deviations right now in the code. Decide which
  ones should should be ironed out and which we'll file deviation
  records.
